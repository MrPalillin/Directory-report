# Directory-report
Small bash utility to list all files in a directory and create a csv file with basic info.
## Usage
In the directory of the script, run:
```
*bash directory_report.sh <path_to_report>*
```
This creates a **results.csv** with the information of all files in the directory. This does not create lines for subdirectories.
